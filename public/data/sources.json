    "description": "Abstract\n\nBetween 1999 and 2002, Cable and Wireless (C&amp;W) undertook a radical strategic repositioning as it sought to become more focused on key growth markets. Due to a combination of a declining external environment and an inadequate external environment, this process of strategic change failed to establish the company as an Internet powerhouse.\nThis article examines the strategic repositioning undertaken by Cable and Wireless throughout the period 1999 to 2002.",
